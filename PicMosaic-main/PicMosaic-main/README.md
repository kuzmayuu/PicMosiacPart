# PicMosaic

Welcome to **PicMosaic**! This is a for our CSIT284 class, guided by Sir Amparo. Originally called Photo Collager (nyucks!), we renamed it to something a bit catchier(?). PicMosaic makes it easy to create photo collages with a few simple steps. This repository is just a place for us to share our project—it’s not an official submission or anything formal.
